\description{
Based on the hyperparameters defined in the config.yml, XGBoost hyperparameter-tuning is
carried out using cross-validation. The best model is chosen and returned.
If defined/necessary, downsampling will be performed as part of the hyperparameter-tuning.
The results of the hyperparameter will be plotted and exported as a dataframe.
